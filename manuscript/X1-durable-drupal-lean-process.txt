# Appendix 1. DurableDrupal Lean Process. Overview {#appendix01}

What follows is an overview of how to make use of the process, with links drilling down to useful guides and templates you can use immediately as you go along. 

T> If you would like more background, please feel free to skip first to the [Agile Software Development. Background and Resources](#agile-background-resources) section.

We will describe the process via a listing of typical chronological steps and activities, although it is important to bear in mind that certain projects will want to tailor the use of the tools and artifacts to their own contexts.

### Project inception

Somewhere, somehow the project is born. 



## Agile Software Development. Background and Resources {#agile-background-resources}

### Introduction

The difficulty of getting a birds' eye view of any software development process is that it is at its heart a grammar and specialized vocabulary, a set of conventions, tools and structures used dynamically and creatively in real world contexts. When it is used of course, it appears as a logical sequence. Like title, author, sections, sentences, phrases, words and expressions in a blog entry, or a series of instructions in a manual. But any attempt at explaining the grammar runs the risk of reducing the whole dialog to boring and lifeless abstractions. 

When we're learning, of course, we need a list of conventions, a vocabulary, and a grammar allowing us to see the options we have in making use of process, and in order to understand the language when we are new to a team.

Remarkably, incremental and iterative software development is nothing new at all, and [goes at least as far back as the Waterfall model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#History). 

### Why use process at all

Work is a social process, ever since we gained an opposable thumb. It's also an historical process. Why do we want to engineer things using today's tools and processes? Simply in order to avoid making the same expensive mistakes over and over again, and to avoid inventing the wheel when we tool up for a product.

### Waterfall

The baseline in software development is what is called the [Waterfall Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model).

[Winston W. Royce's original article Managing the Development of Large Software Systems](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Process/waterfall.pdf) (interesting that even it includes quite a bit on iteration)

A> The waterfall model is a sequential design process, used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation and Maintenance.
A>
A> The waterfall development model originates in the manufacturing and construction industries; highly structured physical environments in which after-the-fact changes are prohibitively costly, if not impossible. Since no formal software development methodologies existed at the time, this hardware-oriented model was simply adapted for software development.[1]
A>
A> > [Wikipedia: Waterfall Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

In following the Waterfall Model, the various disciplines are executed in a single, non-iterative cycle: Requirements, Design, Construction, Integration, Testing, Installation and Maintenance. 

Waterfall may still be the mest process model for your project if it is static in requirements and it is unlikely or prohibitively expensive for changes to be made and there is an insurmountable need for pinpoint estimates in scheduling and resources.

For many other kinds of projects, however, including most website and web app projects, Waterfall can be a recipe for disaster.

### What's wrong with Waterfall?

In projects where changes are very likely to occur along the way, or in which technology is changing rapidly, the Waterfall Model accentuates the risk of failure:

* Because of the long delay between initial assumptions and requirements gathering and delivery, the probability of erroneous feature sets being implemented that do not really comply with real user and organizational requirements is greatly amplified.
* Because changes (scope creep) are bound to happen (40% of the requirements is a common minimum figure) but are not recognized officially, either the real costs exceed budgeted costs by far, or else long and even critical delays are often occasioned.
* Since testing is not done on the unit, integration and quality assurance levels, the cost and impact of repairing anomalies is much higher and the overall quality of the product suffers.
* Elevated cost of failure means there is no room for error, and leads to a costly fear of experimentation on all fronts.

### Better ways of developing software. The Agile Manifesto

The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), defending a leaner, iterative and incremental approach to software development, bases itself on following 12 principles 

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.

> Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.

> Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.

> Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.

> The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

> Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.

> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.

Q> ## This author is proud to have [signed the Agile Manifesto in August 2006](http://agilemanifesto.org/sign/display.cgi?ms=000000067)

Q> Victor Kane: (AWebFactory) Building software must be built around real human needs, and neither the product nor the process shoved down people's throats. The need for software and the need to produce that software must be framed in a process (the process mirrored in the product - Hudson), is optimized by open, flowing structures reflecting those very real needs and their most excellent solutions. Obstacles imposed by greed and the need to defend privilege must be removed. Working people who produce and use software must together manage that process themselves, worldwide.

### Kanban

TODO Kanban section

Kanban is where Agile and one of its industrial manufacturing predecessars, JIT (Just in Time). And is what gives origin to the today's everyday agile expression "Just enough, just in time".
