# Chapter 2 - DurableDrupalDistro

El Viejo certainly had our attention.

"We'll first show you [how to set up a workspace](a_workspace_in_a_lamp_stack.html), getting a folder somewhere you can configure as a Drupal doc root, that is, the main Drupal directory that can be picked up by a LAMP stack and made available to a browser as a URL.

This can be done on a dedicated server, on a VPS, on a virtual machine or directly on your laptop, even on a good shared hosting, but you've got to have ssh access to the command line.

We all need to be able to do this no matter what our role on the team, so we'll show you a couple of examples.

Then we'll see [how to grab our very own DurableDrupalDistro and fire it up](obtaining_and_installing_the_durabledrupaldistro.html).

Finally, we'll [check out what we have going for us](whats_included_in_durabledrupaldistro.html) under the hood right off-the-shelf, we'll [take our first steps](durabledrupaldistro_first_steps.html), and then I'll give an example of [updating and maintaining the distro itself](updating_durabledrupaldistro_itself.html)".

## Getting a workspace in a LAMP stack

El Viejo shows here how to set up a workspace from scratch, in his usual opinionated fashion.

* on a [VPS](#vps) like Linode or Digital Ocean,
* on personal laptop/workstation alternatives
  * [Water Works stack](#water-works-stack)
  * [Bitnami](#bitnami)
    * Drupal App
    * Drupal Server
  * [Kalabox](#kalabox)
* [Roll your own](#roll-your-own)
* on a [shared hosting account](#shared-hosting-account) with command line access and drush

### VPS
TODO linode

TODO digital ocean

### Water Works stack

Well, Water Works never got around to offering one, or else they did and then started charging for it, so nobody used it and it died. But Acquia has one! Very convenient for running Drupal apps on your laptop, but it isn't a virtual machine, it's an app only, so that means that while you can run it and everything, it doesn't emulate the target live environment (a GOOD idea) the app will be running on when it is launched. Get it [here](http://www.acquia.com/downloads).

### Bitnami

[Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/drupal) swings both ways, with the app approach and the VirtualBox VM alternative (recommended but [a lot of work](http://awebfactory.com/node/524) and then [more work](http://awebfactory.com/node/525)).

### Pantheon
Single click .....

And you can have the best of both worlds, with pantheon in the cloud and on your desk... Kalabox!

### Kalabox

Ah, the amigos at [Kalamuna](http://www.kalamuna.com/) are a breath of fresh air. They've not only come up with [Kalabox](http://www.kalamuna.com/products/kalabox) but are now developing [Kalabox 2](https://github.com/kalabox), the [NodeWebkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) wonder, as a completely open source project after a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kalabox/kalabox-advanced-web-tools-for-the-people).

I've tried it out quite a bit. See [how I installed Kalabox 1](http://awebfactory.com/node/522) and used it as a Pantheon workflow solution. Integration with [Pantheon hosting](https://www.getpantheon.com/) and their one-click Drupal Distro site builder is a hallmark of Kalabox 1. Very useful considering its [revolutionary architecture](https://www.getpantheon.com/how-it-works) and [standardizing workflow](https://www.getpantheon.com/how-it-works) (at least as far as Drupal hosting is concerned). Alternative hosting support plug-ins are expected with Kalabox 2.

### Ansible
(study up on Ansible for Dev-Ops book first! buy the bundle!)
* Ansible on a Mac to run a server
* Ansible on a Mac to run a local vagrant/vbox instance

 




### Roll your own
sthg about virtual box & vagrant, with puppet, chef, ansible...

### Shared hosting account
We shouldn't even be talking about this, but recent improvements in shared hosting accounts have made something like a reseller account somewhat (only just) viable, at least for hosting small to middling projects.

First thing to do is get Drush on there, once you've gotten ssh command-line access, if you can't get that switch hosting now (and if you're even reading this section, second thing is to create a subdomain for each site: don't go running Drupal from a sub-directory).

## Obtaining and installing the DurableDrupalDistro

So we're in oue workspace, let's say on a VPS.

### What we want to do

* Create virtual host
* Create database
* Clone and set up distro
* Install with drush on the command line
* Check it out

#### Create virtual host

Update information last refreshed: Tue, 10/21/2014 - 13:20
NOTE: A security update for the Drupal core is available.
Drupal core will be updated after all of the non-core projects are updated.

Security and code updates will be made to the following projects: Calendar [calendar-7.x-3.5], CKEditor - WYSIWYG HTML editor [ckeditor-7.x-1.16], Profiler Builder [profiler_builder-7.x-1.2]

Note: A backup of your project will be stored to backups directory if it is not managed by a supported version control system.
Note: If you have made any modifications to any file that belongs to one of these projects, you will have to migrate those modifications after updating.
Do you really want to continue with the update process? (y/n):

Code updates will be made to drupal core.
WARNING:  Updating core will discard any modifications made to Drupal core files, most noteworthy among these are .htaccess and robots.txt.  If you have made any modifications to these files, please back them up before updating so that you can re-create your modifications in the updated version of the file.
Note: Updating core can potentially break your site. It is NOT recommended to update production sites without prior testing.

Now we need to prepare the site (see [Quick install for developers (command line)](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/developers)

    cp sites/default/default.settings.php sites/default/settings.php

Give the web server write privileges (666 or u=rw,g=rw,o=rw) to the configuration file.

    chmod a+w sites/default/settings.php

Give the web server write privileges to the sites/default directory.

    chmod a+w sites/default

so we can re-install from scratch to test. Check out incredible options available with drush help:

~~~~~~~~
$ drush help site-install
Install Drupal along with modules/themes/configuration using the specified
install profile.

Examples:
 drush site-install expert --locale=uk     (Re)install using the expert install
                                           profile. Set default language to
                                           Ukranian.
 drush site-install                        Install using the specified DB
 --db-url=mysql://root:pass@localhost:por  params.
 t/dbname
 drush site-install                        Install using SQLite (D7+ only).
 --db-url=sqlite://sites/example.com/file
 s/.ht.sqlite
 drush site-install --account-name=joe     Re-install with specified uid1
 --account-pass=mom                        credentials.
 drush site-install standard               Pass additional arguments to the
 install_configure_form.site_default_coun  profile (D7 example shown here - for
 try=FR                                    D6, omit the form id).
 my_profile_form.my_settings.key=value
 drush site-install                        Disable email notification during
 install_configure_form.update_status_mod  install and later. If your server
 ule='array(FALSE,FALSE)'                  has no smtp, this gets rid of an
                                           error during install.

Arguments:
 profile                                   the install profile you wish to run.
                                           defaults to 'default' in D6,
                                           'standard' in D7+
 key=value...                              any additional settings you wish to
                                           pass to the profile. Fully supported
                                           on D7+, partially supported on D6
                                           (single step configure forms only).
                                           The key is in the form [form
                                           name].[parameter name] on D7 or just
                                           [parameter name] on D6.

                                           may use download command to get
                                           them.
