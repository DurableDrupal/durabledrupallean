# Chapter 1 - First Lean DurableDrupalDistro Project
 
To find out what DurableDrupal Lean is all about, let's dive right in and work through a project together using the DurableDrupalDistro. We'll show how the team works together in full parallel cross-collaboration from start to finish. As always there will be some room for improvement, and this will be caught in the process retrospective at the end of the chapter. We will then drill down in later chapters in "just enough" detail as we work through a second and more substantive real life project.

## First meeting with the client
I met with Stuart on Skype. He told me about a neighborhood non-profit that runs programs for youth in the community. They've had a webmaster who managed the content on their site for them, but he seems to have disappeared and they've lost access to their old stuff. Actually they've been wanting to re-do their site for some time, so they have some ideas, but now they're stuck. They want to be able to manage their content without depending on anyone else for that.


----- TODO rework the following on the basis of our actual Lean process followed for the chapter project.

## Exactly how we build this thing

* Getting the team together
  * Provisioning
  * See Appendix 1 xxxxx on why the team chose DurableDrupalDistro as the framework of choice for this project. 
* First planning session
  * Value hypotheses
  * Testing
* Second planning session 
  * MVP Specification based on "what we now know"
  * Establish initial sprint backlog
* Provisioning for development and staging
  * Tailor distro to project
  * Provision team with local VMs on their laptops
* First user story
  * Design studio
  * Estimates
  * Acceptance test
* Successive user stories
* Sprint Acceptance
* Retrospective



## Getting the team together

## Kickoff session

**See https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/issues/3 and refactory this whole outline accordingly**

### Value hypotheses

### Testing

## Second planning session 

### MVP Specification based on "what we now know"

### Establish initial sprint backlog

## Provisioning for development and staging

### Tailor distro to project

### Provision team with local VMs on their laptops

## First user story

### Design studio

### Estimates

### Acceptance test

## Successive user stories

## Sprint Acceptance

## Retrospective (or Agile is the new Waterfall)


So in this chapter we ran with the DurableDrupalDistro, built and delivered our project and installed in on our maintenance stack. After which we complied with the solemn retrospective and reviewed our list of lessons learned.

For the rest of the book, we are going to drill down into the different moments of a more challenging project, as we learn how to overcome agile alone as the new waterfall, incorporating the painful lessons learned by the start-ups, as we adopt the lean process.
