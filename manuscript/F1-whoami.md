I am [Victor Kane (@victorkane)](https://www.drupal.org/user/36006), user 36006 on Drupal.org, where you can find my complete profile. As Owner/Director of AWebFactory.com for [more than eight years](http://awebfactory.com/node/96) I've been developing Drupal powered sites since 2006. I participated in my first DrupalCon in 2007 in Barcelona. I work building sites and web applications, and increasingly as team mentor for agencies, organizations and companies, so that they can deliver their products and embark upon an internal organization-wide process of continuous improvement.
