# Introduction {#intro-00}

DurableDrupal Lean doesn't care which version of Drupal we are on. It doesn't care which hosting or platform we are using.

It only cares that our process be future proof and vendor proof without exception (and that even includes Drupal, which is committed to based on best long-term value: see [Appendix 2. Overcoming Choice Panic. What frameworks should we use?](#appendix-02)). It only cares that the process be free, freely accessible and open to everyone as their right; and that the process stride forward on the material foundation of DevOps, Lean UX and a curated quick-start Distro for our organization and teams; and that this is Drupal: empowerment, sí; submission to the business models of Big Tech and the special needs of big multinational corporations, no!

We shall migrate to new Drupal releases as soon as they provide an advantage in value. And we shall be ready. So now, we shall work in Drupal 8 as soon as there is a published upgrade path between successive minor releases and a release candidate in place or at least in sight (see [Larry Garfield's criteria discussed in Appendix 2](#appendix-02-when-d8-prod)), at which point [it will definitely provide greater value](#appendix-02-d8-benefits). 

In the meantime we shall use a well-defined sub and superset of Drupal 7, in both the form of a specified back-port rich distro as well as that of a truly modern best practices based process. We shall work in Drupal 7 as if it were Drupal 8 and in preparation for joining the web application renaissance which is the wider context of Drupal 8.

This approach, both in code and in process, constitutes DurableDrupal Lean.

## Tool up for solid web apps now and maintain them for years with a powerful Drupal distro

Lightweight and practical, easy to use and flexible, it is a concise approach to building and evolving our organization's continuous improvement in its software and especially web development process. It synthesizes Agile + Lean + Lean UX + DevOps + (Core Model + structured content) in order for teams to develop dynamic websites and web apps using one or more tailored and evolving solid Drupal distros. The objective is to build testable and evolving outcomes for content centric projects capable of lasting for years, now. To make our lives easier all round and to measurably enhance our success rate. And to stop wasting time, money and resources!

## Diving in with a real world project

DurableDrupal Lean needs a website to sell this book. Victor Kane, the author, feels that the book has an important contribution to make to folks trying to set themselves up developing dynamic websites and web applications in the midst of immense uncertainty, change and crisis in the industry, with escalating cost to market for deliverables and confusion as to how to evaluate what value is actually being delivered. The objective is to empower small and medium sized businesses and organizations, working as individuals or at small to medium development shops, with a solid process and readily available open source tools. For #SmallDrupal.

## Overview of Book Contents

So here's what we'll be doing:

* Chapter 1. 

* Chapter 2.

* Appendix 1. DurableDrupal Lean Process Itself.
  
    We need to free ourselves from choice panic which can paralyze us or disrupt our work. Dialog is necessary to ensure that the project stakeholders (all of them) are on board with the major framework optionss. We need to have this discussion sooner rather than later in order to share a common perspective and be ready to get down to work. In order to achieve this, we will be facing some tough questions together:
    
  * Building from scratch or not? Frameworks or not?
  * Proprietary or not? Open-source or not?
  * WordPress or not?
  * Drupal or not?
  * Drupal 8 or not?
  * Backdrop or not?
  * Vanilla Drupal 7 or not? Distro or not?
  * Presenting DurableDrupalDistro: fork it, tailor it, maintain it, branch and release it over all your projects!
  * Preparing to migrate gradually all along, so we'll be ready when the time comes
 
 * Appendix 2. Overcoming Choice Panic - What frameworks should we use?
 
 * Appendix 3. Team Workflow and Provisioning

## Formatting Conventions

This book follows [industry standard formatting and typographical conventions](https://leanpub.com/help/manual) for web development books. 

## Obtaining and using the DurableDrupalDistro and other code examples

This is a book we need to work through together, so a starter Drupal Distro has been provided. 

> For team dev, integration, staging and production DurableDrupalDistro provisioning, fork and adapt (or directly download and use) the [Ansible playbook for setting up Durable Drupal Distro](https://github.com/victorkane/ansible-vagrant-durable-drupal-distro).

> Or grab the [DurableDrupalDistro](https://github.com/victorkane/durable-drupal-distro) itself and build out as you like.

### At a minimum

Thanks to all the modern tools that have come along, all you really need is a laptop with some disk space and a decent amount of RAM. And we promise not to dirty it up with a lot of "server" stuff, thanks to Vagrant, Virtual Box, Ansible and Docker. We'll be setting up complete self-contained server replicas that won't affect your regular configuration at all. And you'll be able to follow through all the examples throughout the book.
