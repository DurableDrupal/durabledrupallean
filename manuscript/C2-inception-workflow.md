# Chapter 2. Project Inception. Workflow {#chapter-02}

## Frameworks to be used

During the course of the prioritization of these jobs, which we will see up close in the next chapter dealing with their associated workflow, there were a few heated discussions, on which framework to use for the project, for example, as well as how the team environments should be provisioned.
[Appendix 2. Overcoming Choice Panic. What frameworks should we use?](#appendix-02) thrashes out this important and confusing question. 

> In this appendix we'll be putting Choice Panic behind us and making a firm decision on the CMS framework we'll be using for our content-centric projects. First we'll place all our doubts right on the table for all to see: Should we be using Drupal for this project? really? is Drupal secure after 7.32? What about Backdrop? What about Drupal 8? Should we use that? Then we sift through the options, and choose the best one as our initial hypothesis. In making that decision we'll base ourselves on our current backlog of projects and on the information we actually have to go on right now. And that can change quickly, so we are not married to any framework, we simply want the best tools to get the job done. We'll explore that particular choice and the characteristics that make it the most versatile and dynamic option open to us. We want to be comfortable with the decision, and have the whole team all on the same page.
