# Introduction

## Tool up for solid web apps now and maintain them for years with a powerful Drupal distro

This book is for web app development teams, called upon by their clients to move their business model to the internet, their back-office to the cloud.

This book will empower you and your team, no matter what your level of expertise, to simplify the building of solid solutions for your clients' real needs, and to facilitate in a productive and cost-effective manner the maintenance these solutions will be crying out for from the moment they are born.

In the process, you will actually be evolving for yourselves a lean web factory to output durable solutions that can be maintained for years to come.

Because successful web developers and agencies know that the real challenge is how to embrace continual delivery throughout the web app life cycle.

**Delivering websites and web apps is only the beginning. The real question for success in web development is how to continue to ply your client with continual fixes and releases in order to fix problems and satisfy change requests.**

Because constant change is inevitable, and ever-present in the life-cycle: 

* First in the minimum of 40% in changes that will be requested in the weeks or months of development.
* Secondly, in the feature and usability requests the solution will have to assimilate in order to maintain its value over time.
* Thirdly in the security threats that will have to be dealt with in as fully an automated way as possible.
* Fourthly in the architectural and deployment changes that will be required as time goes by, in the struggle to scale with growth and cut costs with new technological breakthroughs.

Because it's not about the "single click site generation" and easy scaffolding any decent framework or "hosting" solution offers. We'll soon see how to fire up a framework in seconds, in just a few clicks, but the devil is in how we empower ourselves with a process that is going to facilitate, stabilize and simplify our work in the face of this constant change we need to flow with.

We're here for the long haul.

And we're using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) now.

So here's what we'll be doing:

* Chapter 1: Overcoming Choice Panic - What frameworks should we use?
  
    We need to free ourselves from choice panic which can paralyze us or disrupt our work at any time if the project stakeholders aren't all on board with the major framework and other choices that will be made during the appropriate iterations. We need to have this discussion sooner rather than later, and realize that as time goes on we'll always be migrating. Realizing that will allow us to prepare gradually and ease the pain. Hey, it's part of the job!
    
  * This is what we need and we need it now
  
      We need to adopt a process which bases itself brutally on what we need and what our clients need, and which abandons vested vendor lock-in of all kinds. We can't be married to frameworks: it's one big open-source community and its one big set of solutions we must achieve
      
  * Building from scratch or not? Frameworks or not?
  * Proprietary or not? Open-source or not?
  * WordPress or not?
  * Drupal or not?
  * Drupal 8 or not?
  * Backdrop or not?
  * Vanilla Drupal 7 or not? Distro or not?
  * Presenting DurableDrupalDistro: fork it, tailor it, maintain it, branch and release it over all your projects!
  * Preparing to migrate gradually all along, so we'll be ready when the time comes

* Chapter 2: Setting up just enough shop to deliver our first web app
  * Every team member has their own dev environment
    * On Pantheon
    * On Amazon
  * What the client needs
    * The tangle of User Stories and Design
  * Fork the distro and make it our own
  * User stories and doing it with agile
  * Delivery as client empowerment
  * Post mortem: We did it! But...
    * Agile is the new waterfall (pixel perfect design -> "implementation")
    * Team couldn't really work in parallel
    * Client took delivery of a monolithic blob he wasn't sure how to use
      * We had to do special training (not to mention train the trainers)
      * Client began a slew of change requests that could have come earlier if they had been familiar with the system
    
* Chapter 3: Agile is the new waterfall - we need Lean!
  * New project!
  * Value hypotheses
  * Design studio for nerds... and for the client too
  * Getting the team working in parallel
  
* Chapter 4: Functional prototypes

* Chapter 5: Grabbing the legacy content

* Chapter 6: Candidate architecture
  * Choices panic revisited
  * We're evolving on top of best of breed

* Chapter 7: Build the recursive MVP of MVP's
  * Every user story is an MVP
  * No project is ever anything more than an MVP
  
* Chapter 8: Go team test team go go go

    The advantage of using frameworks isn't just that they're tried and tested, but that they empower testing and TTD
* Chapter 9: Build, deploy, maintain
  * Rinse and repeat over "development"

But more than a book this is a community of teams. Dive in!
