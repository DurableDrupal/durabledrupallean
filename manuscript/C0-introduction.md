# Introduction {#chapter-00}

## Tool up for solid web apps now and maintain them for years with a powerful Drupal distro

## Overview of Book Contents

So here's what we'll be doing:

* Chapter 1. 

* Chapter 2.

* Appendix 1. DurableDrupal Lean Process. Overview
  
    We need to free ourselves from choice panic which can paralyze us or disrupt our work. Dialog is necessary to ensure that the project stakeholders (all of them) are on board with the major framework optionss. We need to have this discussion sooner rather than later in order to share a common perspective and be ready to get down to work. In order to achieve this, we will be facing some tough questions together:
    
  * Building from scratch or not? Frameworks or not?
  * Proprietary or not? Open-source or not?
  * WordPress or not?
  * Drupal or not?
  * Drupal 8 or not?
  * Backdrop or not?
  * Vanilla Drupal 7 or not? Distro or not?
  * Presenting DurableDrupalDistro: fork it, tailor it, maintain it, branch and release it over all your projects!
  * Preparing to migrate gradually all along, so we'll be ready when the time comes
 
 * Appendix 2. Overcoming Choice Panic - What frameworks should we use?
 
 * Appendix 3. Team Workflow and Provisioning

## Formatting Conventions

This book follows [industry standard formatting and typographical conventions](https://leanpub.com/help/manual) for web development books. 

## Obtaining and using the DurableDrupalDistro and other code examples

This is a book we need to work through together, so a starter Drupal Distro has been provided. 

> For team dev, integration, staging and production DurableDrupalDistro provisioning, fork and adapt (or directly download and use) the [Ansible playbook for setting up Durable Drupal Distro](https://github.com/victorkane/ansible-vagrant-durable-drupal-distro).

> Or grab the [DurableDrupalDistro](https://github.com/victorkane/durable-drupal-distro) itself and build out as you like.

### At a minimum

Thanks to all the modern tools that have come along, all you really need is a laptop with some disk space and a decent amount of RAM. And we promise not to dirty it up with a lot of "server" stuff, thanks to Vagrant, Virtual Box, Ansible and Docker. We'll be setting up complete self-contained server replicas that won't affect your regular configuration at all. And you'll be able to follow through all the examples throughout the book.
