# Chapter 1. Project Inception {#chapter-01}

We are diving right into a real world project, the Durable Drupal Website, in order to demonstrate. But just where do we dive in? Where does inception live?

## First team meeting.

We start with an empty Kanban board. There are four columns:

* New
* To do
* In Progress
* MVP 1

Jeff is using [Trello](https://trello.com/) to create the board (Figure 1-1).

A team meeting is held to get the ball rolling. The team is made up as follows:

* Anna (Product Owner)
* Jake (DevOps)
* Mark (UX)
* Jeff (Back end)
* Lisa (Front end)
* Victor (Project Coach)
* Sherrie (Graphic design)

Anna starts the meeting by reading out a vision of what a minimum viable product ([MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)) might be in this particular case:

> Due to the current world economic crisis companies are struggling to stave off failure and bankruptcy which will inevitably result from continuing business as usual. Companies are driven to cut costs and find new competitive products at a tremendous pace.
>
> In the realm of computing hardware, [Moore's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) observes that in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries "the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years." Just as this is closely related to the exponential growth in memory capacity and the number of pixels in digital cameras, in the software industry we can observe similar high rates of growth in the complexity and features offered by operating systems and applications which thrive atop the complexity of the devices they run on as well as the ever increasing number of different kinds of devices.
>
> Since open source projects by and large are able to cope with growing complexity up to a limit of a million lines of code, due to the positive effects of community curation and testing, part and parcel of open source, there has also been an exponential growth in the use of open source projects by all kinds of organizations, by non-profits, and by large corporations and government agencies. This in turn drives even greater complexity in open source projects as they are driven by influencers and "owners" to meet the needs of "enterprise".
>
> As a result, the real cost to market of content-centric web publishing tools based on CMS (content management system) frameworks and platforms has skyrocketed. However, small and medium sized businesses, non-profits, advocacy groups and their publications, and individual professionals are all rushing to avail themselves of functionality and features that would have been unheard of just a few years ago.
>
> On the one hand, this is an exciting time for small and medium shops and even individual developers, eager to rise to the occasion and grab the chance of being able to empower their non-enterprise small and medium sized clients. By the same token, enormous pressures are generated by excessively high levels of client expectations, given the real level of resources required, and given the high learning curve and additional costs required for the application of industry-wide best practices required for success.
>
> We can offer tools and solutions for these problems in the form of an optimized path towards the adquisition of skills in the use of industry best practices and process, in the context of a long term Drupal 7 distribution. All of this can be marshalled for the creation of an evolving factory for the development of dynamic websites and web applications. Once in place, this factory can evolve in step with today's rapid pace of change as part of a journey ...

The reading of the MVP Vision is interrupted at this point and Victor proposes that the team build a prototype with that text featured on the home page as a skeleton website. This is to be used as a snap starting point on an immediate concrete footing. The process to be followed will have a lot in common with upcoming MVP iterations, and tools and infrastructure can be decided upon even in the case of a stripped-down prototype and incomplete MVP vision. This as part of the preparation for the Kickoff, when the team's task will be to cut to the core of that vision in order to penetrate what the project is really about and what is to be done. In order to reach team consensus, that is, on the characteristics of the initial testable MVP.

The rest of the meeting is used to plan out on the Kanban board the minimum number of steps required to build the prototype as quickly and directly as possible. 

After some discussion, the Kanban board looks like this:

The main thing to understand about Kanban is that it is not based on the pre-estimated "sprints" designed to deliver a complete mini-release one finds when using Scrum. Rather it is a continuous flow process. Core outcomes are implemented one at a time, and their associated issues pass through various states (represented by columns) in the process. At the start all issues are placed in the New column (state). Then a few are prioritized and are placed in the limited backlog "To Do" column, which is a limited column. When team members work on an issue, it is placed in the "In Progress" or "Doing" column. This column is also limited in the number of issues it can contain. The reason for this is the key to why Kanban is different: it champions focus and prohibits people working on too many things at the same time. This is called a Work in Progress (WIP) limit, and it replaces the constraint of the sprint cycle length found in Scrum. In this way, Kanban frees us from waterfall-like mini-release "estimates". So while there are no sprints, only a continuous flow of work being done, the key constraint for each state is to be found in the WIP limit, which can be found in parenthesis in the To Do and In Progress column titles. The actual number is calculated and optimized by taking into account team size and velocity, and is adjusted flexibly as the project matures.

Another benefit is that since the focus is on jobs of work and not abstract mini-releases, it is much easier to foster multi-discipline cross-collaboration. 

Lets take a look at the individual (tasks, wot?)

vision -> cut to the core in kick-off meeting
provisioning of team dev environments 

First of all, everything is pushed into the New column. Then ...

We limit the To Do column and the Doing column to 3 (number of separate disciplines being worked on with semi-paired programming).

There were a couple of heated discussions.

## frameworks to be used

## provisioning for dev environments

## deployment

## other tasks needed to plan for the kick-off
