# Chapter 1. Project Inception {#chapter-01}

We are diving right into a real world project, the Durable Drupal Website, in order to demonstrate. But just where do we dive in? Where does inception live?

## First team meeting.

We start with an empty Kanban board. There are four columns:

* New
* To do
* In Progress
* MVP 1

Jeff used [Trello](https://trello.com/) to create the board (Figure 1-1).

A team meeting was called to get the ball rolling.

Anna (Product Owner).
Jake (DevOps)
Mark (UX)
Jeff (Back end)
Lisa (Front end)
Victor (Project Coach)
Sherrie (Graphic design)

Anna started the meeting with the MVP vision:

, and saying, let's just stick this up as a website so we have a prototype starting point to show to people and let's stick up the minimum steps required to get there as quickly as possible.

After some discussion, the Kanban board looked like this:

We limited the To Do column and the Doing column to 3 (number of separate disciplines being worked on with semi-paired programming).

We wrote the MVP acceptance test first.

There were a couple of heated discussions.
