# Appendix 1. DurableDrupal Lean Process. Overview {#appendix01}

DurableDrupal Lean is a process factory, providing reusable tools and methods for a team or team of teams within an organization, with the firm purpose of defeating waterfall and guaranteeing delivered value. 

Now, that's a mighty set of phrases right there. If we understood that sentence and knew how to use it on a daily basis, we could end this right now and go have a beer. Well, let's read on. And then go have a beer. For now, let's hunker down and do what we always do when we want to learn something: deconstruct it, that is, take it apart; and then synthesize our own process by putting it back together again, both abstractly, and then as we work through this book, in actual practice.

* A process factory
  * Because we don't want to take a rigid scheme and mechanically force ourselves to go through motions that may or may not have anything to do with who we are or what we are trying to accomplish. We want to learn how to create, recreate, evolve and maintain our own process, on every team in our organization, for every different kind of project.
* DurableDrupal Lean
  * We must be in the habit of using upstream Drupal distributions in our organization. In this book we are providing one, [DurableDistro](https://github.com/DurableDrupal/durable-drupal-distro), along with an Ansible playbook to easily provision it with Vagrant. W think it will give you a great head start and it can be easily curated as needed; and we also list [a lot of the most useful ones out there](#appendix-02-distributions) which you can use for many specialized purposes right off the shelf. The question as always is to stand on the shoulders of giants.
  * Lean: Agile is the new Waterfall. We need Lean, and we want you to know what this software development process is all about and why it should be important to you.
  * See below for explanation of what is Waterfall, Agile, Lean, etc.
* Reusable tools and methods
  * We want to review them here. Later on you will make your own. We want to keep it down to a dull roar though, in order to avoid top heavy, documentation laden wastes of time.
* For a team or team of teams.
  * We are talking continuous improvement in your organization, whether it's a one man shop (still a team!), an agency or company department   

## A very short history of modern software development process

Why use process at all? Well, work is social in nature, ever since we humans gained an opposable thumb. It is also historical. So why do we want to engineer things using today's tools and processes? Certainly in order to avoid making the same expensive mistakes over and over again, and to avoid inventing the wheel when we tool up for a product.

But the main reason we need process is to avoid wasting time, money and resources. To avoid failing. Again and again.

When we begin to try to understand a software development process that's described to us as the next best thing since sliced bread, the difficulty of getting that birds' eye view is that it is at its heart a grammar and specialized vocabulary, a set of conventions, tools and structures which only come alive when they are used dynamically and creatively in real world contexts. When it is used of course, it appears as a logical sequence. Like title, author, sections, sentences, phrases, words and expressions in a blog entry, or a series of instructions in a manual. But any attempt at explaining the grammar runs the risk of reducing the whole dialog to boring, lifeless and most importantly, useless abstractions. 

But when we're learning, of course, we need a list of conventions, a vocabulary, and a grammar allowing us to see the options we have in making use of process, and in order to understand the language when we are new to a team. It's like starting to code using a new programming language and scrolling through the docs.

### Achieving a still better process with Lean UX and Design + Dev

### The Best Process we Know: Design + Dev + DevOps

### Waste that is eliminated by using DurableDrupal Lean

Waste is of course, the opposite of value. We sum up by reviewing the possible causes of waste in software development:

* Unfinished work left rotting in isolated silos
* Feature creep without validating for impact or value
* Isolated silos keep on re-inventing the wheel
* Handoffs chronically disrupts workflow
* Delays because isolated silos and teams missing skills
* Task switching because work overload and broken workflow
* Mucho defect because chaotic focus and blocked knowledge sharing
